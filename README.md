# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Purpose of the Analysis

Pewlett-Hackard enjoys an illustrious and storied history. Many of our employees have spent their full career here, and some are getting to the age where retirement may become attractive. 

This analysis will help in pointing out the magnitude of our future needs and provide a breakout by department of where we could be seeing a wave of retirments.

Additionally, this takes a look at how many seasoned employees may be available to provide mentorship to a new generation of leaders.


## Results
[Retiring by Title](RetiringTitles.png)

- As shown in the attached image and retiring_titles.csv in the data folder, over 90 thousand employees may be close to retirement
- We stand to lose 29 thousand senior staff, 28 thousand other senior staff
- We have about 15 hundred employees who could participate in a mentorship program - a good base to build on, but well short of the number of impending retirements; we may want to expand eligibility in this program
- The salary table was not easy to understand - the salaries seemed unrealistically low, and we did not know what the "to" and "from" dates represent. To do any further analyis re: salary of people retiring, we will need clarification.
## Summary

We have about 90 thousand retirements coming up; a mentorship program may help develop skills to replace what we are losing, but as specified, will only develop 15 hundred people at most.

Of these, about 1100 are either senior engineer or senior staff - they may be able to learn new responsibilities, but may have little incentive as they are already senior. There are about 350 engineers or staff who might be interestedin moving forward.
